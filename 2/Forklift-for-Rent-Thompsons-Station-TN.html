<p>In an Order Picking Forklift the Operator goes up into the air with the load and either places pallets mechanically, or moves smaller loads on and off the order picker manually. Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6” suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>

Rough terrain forklifts have the ability to tackle a wide range of site conditions - from pavement and hills to mud and back again. With longer shift life, proven diagnostics, and a global parts and service network, users of the Crown SP Series high-level order pickers are sure to experience more satisfaction, longer forklift life and lower total costs.</p>
