In order to prevent the lift from tipping, the combined center of gravity of the load and the lift must stay inside the stability triangle (at ground level) at all times.</p>
<p>Also, the Entry Bar Safety Switch at the compartment opening on Crown's stand-up and counterbalance reach trucks slows the truck to a stop and sounds an alarm if operators attempt to drive the truck with part of their foot resting on the ledge. This makes the global pallet truck market fragmented in nature. A pallet jack scale or a pallet truck scale can typically lift 120 mm.</p>

<p>As the hydraulic jack at the 'tiller' end is raised, the links force the wheels down, raising the forks vertically above the front wheels, raising the load upward until it clears the floor.
