<p>Forklifts are powered industrial trucks used to lift and move materials in short distances. Operators get excellent visibility with panoramic views of rack, loads and aisle. Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments and is popular for use in large distribution centers.</p>
<p>This alone should be reason enough to ensure your operators are properly trained where safety and health regulations are involved. New and used Reach Trucks are also available depending on the length of rental and budget. Suspension lift kits are best for drivers who are avid off-roaders because they give you additional ground clearance. Industrial counterbalance forklifts can be used in a wide range of applications, like agricultural, beverage distribution and bottling, and retail industries.</p>
