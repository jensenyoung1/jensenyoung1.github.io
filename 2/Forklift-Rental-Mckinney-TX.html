<h2>Forklift Rules Of The Road Mckinney </h2>
<p>If you do most of your work indoors it is unlikely that you'll ever need one, but rough terrain forklifts are a must for outdoor applications and construction sites. Note: Service calls are not officially logged until you hear back from an Eastern Lift Truck Co. employee. It is suggested that powered industrial trucks be painted a color which will comply with the USA Standard Safety Color Code for Marking Physical Hazards and the Identification of Certain Equipment, Z53.1-1967.</p>
<p>Unless you are very experienced and know what to look for when inspecting a forklift, have a qualified mechanic or knowledgeable operator carry out the inspection. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>
<p>Do not alter or eliminate any forklift parts or add any forklift parts or add any accessories such as additional counterweight or lifting attachments unless approved by the manufacturer in writing. Longitudinal stability isn't the only concern for lift truck operators. This is a lifting aid that you can adjust to your requirements, ensuring an efficient workflow, safe for both operators and goods.</p>
