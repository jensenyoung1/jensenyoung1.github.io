When you book with us, you are booking with an experienced company with trainers that have had years of experience working in warehouses picking stock at all different heights on the order picker, trainers that have been safety representatives and store-men. Yes, you can rent indoor forklift for warehouses. Also, a strap or chain is used to attach the man basket to the carriage of the forklift.</p>
<p>Unlike other online shops, our customer support representatives are actual mechanics who are seasoned in fitting, installing, and maintaining truck and SUV air suspension. For instance, if a heavy load brings the center of gravity all the way to the front axle — the theoretical edge of the stability triangle — sudden braking could shift the load forward and out of the triangle altogether.</p>

The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>
<p>A reliable alternative to the Stainless Lifter is the BT Lifter Galvanized LHM230G model with stainless steel axles and galvanized chassis and pump. Some SP Series models feature a 36-volt battery, which enables common batteries and chargers to be used across your lift truck fleet.
