<h2>Lifted Trucks Worthington</h2>
<p>These sorts of lifted trucks drive differently than stock models, due to the change of suspension and higher center of gravity, but can utilize mush larger tires than a factory model. Advances in machinery made life easier for warehouse personnel; one of these important innovations was the pallet jack, which is basically a type of forklift. Many of the most serious forklift accidents happen when a driver drops a payload.</p>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts have four-wheel power steering, but it can be changed into two-wheel as well. The Raymond 4460 sit down forklift features a low profile and excellent operator visibility for exceptional performance and productivity in confined spaces.
