We are a full-service forklift and material handling equipment dealer, proudly located in Phoenix and serving the great state of Arizona. This course covers how to safely and efficiently operate a rough terrain forklift, how to educate and evaluate other operators on their rough terrain forklift performance, identifying when and how to service and maintain forklifts and how to keep other workers around the forklift area safe.</p>
<p>Manufacturers have models of rough terrain forklifts with load capacities ranging from 4000 to 10000 lbs. When unloaded, the forklift's center of gravity is right about here. We have 3 & 4 wheel electric sit down forklifts, stand up counterbalanced electric forklifts, propane powered, cushion tire warehouse forklifts, electric order pickers, stackers, rough terrain telehandlers and reach forklifts.</p>
<h2>Material Handling Lift Tables & Custom Lifts Mercedes </h2>

From our core Mitsubishi brand, to the new economical mlift range, the Bomaq off-road range and the specialist electric carer offerings. MHEDA's mission is to further improve the proficiency of independent material handling distributors in order that they continue to be the most effective and efficient conduit to the marketplace and to be a resource to all industry stakeholders.</p>

Our quality and reputation for reliability make our forklifts ideal for rentals, short or long term.

<h2>Fork Truck Certification Mercedes</h2>
<p>Many rough terrain forklifts come with either two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive options. And one of the biggest barriers to making your warehouse work for you is the forklifts you have at your disposal. Use: Most commonly used forklift in the U.S. Primarily used indoors in warehouse type operations, good for use on smooth surfaces only. Overall Height Raised = The maximum extended height of the top of the load backrest or fork carriage of a completely extended mast.</p>
<p>This includes, but is not limited to, straddle carriers, hustlers, toploaders, container reach stackers, and other vehicles that carry, push, pull, lift, or tier loads. Place empty truck on initially level test platform in a position that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the test platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>
<p>Local businesses that recently purchased a new forklift may be selling the used model directly. As one of the leading manufacturers of materials handling equipment , including a sizable range of counterbalance forklift trucks, our products are designed to withstand even the harshest of environments. With the test load supported by the forks in a normal and unrestrained manner, elevate the load to its maximum height.</p>
<p>Lifted trucks also present a danger to those driving in them. The fuel-efficient cushion tire forklifts from Cat, with lift capacities from 3,000 to 15,500 lbs., are ideal for use in indoor applications with smooth, dry floors, where moving palletized loads to and from a loading dock or storage area is required. Counterbalance forklifts are a straightforward appliance that feature dual forks for heavy loads and bulky items.</p>
