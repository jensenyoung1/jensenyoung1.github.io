Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilizes a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level.</p>
<p>This function is limited to some (Class 2 & 3) Reach Trucks”. Choosing the right lift kit height is critical to maintaining the comfort, ride quality, and utility of your truck. Despite this type of design, counterbalance forklifts aren't immune to accidents.
