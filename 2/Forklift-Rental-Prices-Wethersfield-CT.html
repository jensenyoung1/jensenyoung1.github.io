<p>When you have a pallet jack at your warehouse to help employees tackle tasks that are physically challenging, you avoid this dissatisfaction, which can affect productivity.

Compact and high powered reach trucks of 1.3ton up to 2.5ton capacity offer fast response, easy operation and smooth load handling for high-density warehouse handling efficiency. Although trucks are rated at 24 inches load center, the load center for Test #N3 should be either 24 or 16 inches - whichever would produce the less stable condition.</p>
