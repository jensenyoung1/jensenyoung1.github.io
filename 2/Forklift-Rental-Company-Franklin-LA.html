<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. Trucks with a body lift often have a visible gap between the frame and body, which a lot of people find unsightly. This is due to the fact that a used forklift really has no suspension and it is not possible to maintain tire to ground contact in uneven environments. These fees are based on the length of the time you have your rental. The hand pallet truck lift offers load shifting, lifting and lowering functions.</p>
<p>You must know how to safely load, unload, and drive a rough terrain forklift to prevent accidents and injuries.

If you test drive your lifted trucks hurriedly, you will fail to pay close attention to some signs you should be watching out for.
