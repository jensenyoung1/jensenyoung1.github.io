<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely. Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support. Call Andy Putnam, Rental Manager (315) 413-4150 or use the Rentals Request form to send us a Quick Request.</p>
<p>To obtain a forklift licence in any State or Territory an applicant must undertake a training course with an approved training organisation and then, on completion of the course, apply to the appropriate State or Territory for a forklift licence. If you are not sure how everything works in a lifted truck that you want to test drive, ask questions. Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>

<p>This Nationally Recognised and WorkSafe Victoria Accredited Unit allows you to perform work that requires a forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence. Carefully consider lifting a brand new truck, as this can cause premature wear and added stress to critical components such as shocks, wheel bearings, suspension bushings, ball joints, and tie rods. When your load is sitting on pallets, the forklift prongs can fit easily into the pallet to move and carry your heavy load rapidly.</p>
<p>When you rent a rough terrain forklift, you don't have to wait long to get to work. Daystar "Comfort Ride" Lift Kits combine the best of both worlds in order to give you the most optimal suspension lift all while staying within a reasonable budget. Flexibility is critical for businesses and renting forklifts can be a surprisingly easy way to cut costs on a short-term basis.</p>

Rent diesel or LP-gas forklift or rent a specialized material handling forklift, such as a truck-mounted forklift or piggyback truck. If your company needs a forklift, but your financial manager cringes at the expense of buying one, it's probably time to consider alternative options.</p>
<p>Be sure the load is centered and the forks are completely under the load before lifting. Use these machines to tackle residential or commercial landscaping jobs. 2. Three-Wheel Counterbalance - These forklifts feature three wheels as opposed to four in their counterbalance forerunners.

Although trucks are rated at 24 inches load center, the load center for Test #N3 should be either 24 or 16 inches - whichever would produce the less stable condition.</p>
