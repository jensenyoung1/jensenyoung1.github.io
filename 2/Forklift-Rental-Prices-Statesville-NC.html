<p>Ziglift Material Handling is committed to your material handling needs and is open to service our essential business customers. There are so many things to consider when adding or replacing your used forklift equipment. Today, rough-terrain lifts have become the preferred forklift in agriculture. One of the key features of this type of forklift is that they are counterbalanced — meaning that the battery also functions as a counterweight for stability. Optimize your storage capacity by operating in narrow aisles at high picking levels with Raymond Orderpicker trucks.</p>
<p>This added weight increases the lifting capacity of the unit to between 2,200 and 4,000 lb. The load center is the distance from the forks to the center of gravity of the load. We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA. Built to lift boats in and out of tall storage racks while coping with the corrosive nature of seawater, marina forklifts are over-sized lifts with long, rubber-coated forks.</p>

A pallet jack should be pulled especially when it is loaded. For one thing, any lifted truck has a higher center of gravity than it would as a standard factory model. Select a forklift rental plan that meets your immediate needs, whether short- or long-term.</p>
<p>The Forklift Network has 170 dealers across North America including Canadian Provinces, and has thousands of used electric forklifts for sale. The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it. The name comes from the counterweight in the rear of the vehicle.
