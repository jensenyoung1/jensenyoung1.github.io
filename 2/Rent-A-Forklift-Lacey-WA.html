<h2>Pallet Jack For Sale Lacey</h2>
<p>These sorts of lifted trucks drive differently than stock models, due to the change of suspension and higher center of gravity, but can utilize mush larger tires than a factory model. Advances in machinery made life easier for warehouse personnel; one of these important innovations was the pallet jack, which is basically a type of forklift. Many of the most serious forklift accidents happen when a driver drops a payload.</p>
<p>At least 22% of these deaths were caused by forklift overturns and another 20% to workers on foot being struck by the forklift. In honor of National Forklift Safety Day on June 12, we present our annual ranking of the 10 (actually, 11 due to a tie for 10th place) largest global manufacturers of forklifts, as ranked by revenue. Pallet jacks can bear a lot of weight, but they also have limits that cannot be safely exceeded.</p>
