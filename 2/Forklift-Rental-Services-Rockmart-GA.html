<p>TYPES OF FORKLIFTS: fork crane models for industrial use within warehouses, hydraulic three-wheeled electric forklifts, etc. These types of forklifts can accelerate and travel at higher speeds, which also makes them ideal for outdoor uses. More elaborate lift kits not only raise the body of your truck up but can also increase the clearance of your truck's frame and let you put bigger tires on your pickup. Take a closer look at the most important features to find out how rough terrain forklifts get the job done.</p>
<p>However, industrial-grade masts do reportedly provide more substantial lifting capacity at height, with 6,000-lb and 8,000-lb capacity lifts serving as two popular examples among a number of rental houses. Their manoeuvrability, tires and traction force make them very popular in industries where very heavy loads must be transported on rough or unpaved grounds.</p>

<p>For loads exceeding 2500kg, a motorized pallet jack, "walkie stacker" or Forklift is recommended.

<p>All types of dockboards should be designed and maintained so the end edges will have a substantial contact with the dock (or loading platform) and the carrier to prevent the dockboard from rocking of sliding. The increased tire size and ground clearance makes off-roading increasingly possible by limiting the potential damage of debris, as well as providing an overall smoother ride across the rough ground.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck in standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph E.
