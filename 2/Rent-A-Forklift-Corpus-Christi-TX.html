We offer forklift sales and rentals that include everything from pallet stackers to reach trucks.

Electric models offer a substantially lower cost per hour-of-operation than any of the internal combustion lifts. If you are unsure of what you want in a car, you need to create a shortlist of the trucks that appeal to you.</p>

If you are looking for a second hand forklift for sale, then this is the ideal site to help you.</p>

<p>Highly ergonomic, this low lifting truck offers comfortable steering handle, easy positioning and smooth driving on rough, uneven surfaces. Angled lower backrest provides the operator with a clear view of the fork tips, which makes it easier for the operator to insert the forks into a pallet. Contact us today to discuss how we can help ensure you get the most out of your material handling equipment purchase.</p>
<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing. Prior to 2011 all States and Territories of Australia independently regulated occupational health and safety in that state, including forklift licensing.</p>
<p>An important aspect of forklift operation is that it must have rear-wheel steering While this increases maneuverability in tight cornering situations, it differs from a driver's traditional experience with other wheeled vehicles. They can reach heights up to 390″ Orderpickers are typically powered by 24- or 36-volt industrial batteries. Shock absorbers manage the kinetic energy that travels through your Jeep's suspension and chassis as you drive to give you a bump-free ride and keep other components from wearing out too quickly.</p>

Our Rental Purchase Option (RPO) provides customers with an opportunity to acquire equipment by building equity over the rental period. When properly operated and maintained, a forklift is an invaluable piece of equipment.</p>
<p>You can see how the project goes and determine if you need to add one to your fleet, or if you can simply rent one from time to time. With their 2.4 m long forks, these low level order pickers are able to pick up as many as three pallets weighing up to 2.5 t. These machines are replacing traditional forklifts and rough-terrain forklifts due to their increased versatility, safety and capacity; also, the ability to work better with delivery vehicles, lorries and containers.</p>
<p>While electric forklifts have 64 percent of the entire forklift market, propane has significant market share in the class 4 and 5 forklift markets, according to Jeremy Wishart, director of off-road business development for the Propane Education & Research Council. From construction sites and builder's yards, to special event venues and timber forestry sites, by being so adaptable a rough terrain forklift can maximise on productivity and efficiency.</p>
