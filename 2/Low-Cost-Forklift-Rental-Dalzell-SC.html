An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load. Two lifting-fork order pickers allow the operator to vary the load height to reduce the need for reaching and bending.</p>

Check the areas around and behind your vehicle before putting it in reverse, even if that means you need to temporarily turn the truck off, hop down out of the driver's seat and do a quick check for any children or pedestrians in the area.</p>

The good news is you don't need to have any experience of driving a forklift truck to start learning with an accredited training provider. Our entire range of electric order pickers is characterised by extremely robust construction.

A body lift kit is much simpler to install - it just uses spacers underneath the cab to boost the height of the body. Our Hydraulic Pallet Trucks are used widely for their efficiency and flawless performance.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to omit the overhead guard, special attention should be given by the user and operator to conditions such as height and stability of loads and stacks, weight of individual units, and operating space including overhead obstructions. Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
<p>Forklift operators can lift up and lower the forks, use side shifters to move loads and tilt the mast so the load doesn't slide off the forks. The multidirectional BT Reflex F-series of reach trucks offer AC power, clear-view masts, 360° steering and sideways battery exchange for increased productivity and manoeuvrability. Aimed at a prosperous growth in this domain, we are engaged in offering an excellent quality range of Hydraulic Hand Pallet Truck.</p>

Three-wheel forklift trucks also have models where the operator can either sit down or just stand while operating the truck.</p>
<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>This type of forklift makes use of pneumatic or air-filled tires, as opposed to counterbalance forklifts which use cushion tires. Control pedals and control platforms stood on or engaged by the operator's feet should have non-skid surfaces.
