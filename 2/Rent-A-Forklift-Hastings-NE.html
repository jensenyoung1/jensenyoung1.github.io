<h2>Important Considerations Before You Sign A Forklift Rental Agreement Hastings </h2>
<p>3. 3 Acknowledgment OSHA's Office of Training and Education wishes to acknowledge the following for contributing some of the graphics used in this presentation:  Caterpillar Lift Trucks  Mason Contractors Association of America  Industrial Truck Association  State of Utah Labor Commission - Occupational Safety & Health Division  Steamship Trade Association of Baltimore  Taylor Machine Works, Inc.</p>
<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>
<p>Our Modern Fleet of CLARK and Komatsu forklifts gives you the opportunity to rent our equipment where and when you need it, without delays. As a renter it is your responsibility to make sure you only assign operators you have certified to operate the rental equipment. Lift kits are a popular choice for truck and SUV owners in Conroe and throughout the state of Texas.</p>
