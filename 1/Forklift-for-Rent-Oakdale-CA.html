<p>JCB rough terrain forklifts are a reliable, comfortable, versatile and easy-to-use solution for any challenging rehandling environment.

<p>The primary difference between class 5 models of class 4 are the tires each IC forklift equip.

Detrich says that such features as the clear-view” mast (with lift cylinders on the outside of the mast to provide an unhindered view to the forks), shorter turning radii, hydraulic side-shift of carriage and forks, and improved ergonomic operator platforms result in machines that provide operators with greater control, convenience, and comfort.</p>
<p>While maintaining a small turning radius, the P Series machines are built to a 22,000-pound capacity, and even larger as specifically required. Atlantic Training's "Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks" training program has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>

<h2>Fork Truck Certification Oakdale</h2>
<p>The U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) has guidelines in place to help forklift operators, pallet jack drivers, and other industrial powered truck workers be aware of their machine's ability to lift, maneuver, and store cargo.

<p>When driving rough terrain forklifts, safety should always come first.
