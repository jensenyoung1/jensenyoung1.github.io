<p>Also, this rental service is available to us in many types at pocket-friendly rates. To operate an order-picking forklift truck you need an LO high risk work licence.

There are different models of forklifts, and there are various forklift features that might not be the same with every model.</p>
<h2>Pallet Truck Southampton</h2>
