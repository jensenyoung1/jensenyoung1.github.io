Providing a standup platform rather than a seat allows for the reach truck's shortened length giving it its "tight access" capability. We offer lifted trucks across a variety of models and trim levels, so no matter if you're shopping for a baseline full-size pickup or an upgraded heavy duty model, you can secure whichever you need with a lifted upgrade.</p>
<p>To obtain a forklift licence in any State or Territory an applicant must undertake a training course with an approved training organisation and then, on completion of the course, apply to the appropriate State or Territory for a forklift licence. If you are not sure how everything works in a lifted truck that you want to test drive, ask questions.
