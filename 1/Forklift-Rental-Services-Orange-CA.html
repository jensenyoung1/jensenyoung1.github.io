<h2>Used Material Handling Equipment Orange</h2>
<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>At least 22% of these deaths were caused by forklift overturns and another 20% to workers on foot being struck by the forklift. In honor of National Forklift Safety Day on June 12, we present our annual ranking of the 10 (actually, 11 due to a tie for 10th place) largest global manufacturers of forklifts, as ranked by revenue.
