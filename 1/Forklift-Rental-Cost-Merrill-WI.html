<h2>Industrial Material Lifts Merrill </h2>

<h2>Pallet Jack Parts Merrill</h2>

Many of the most serious forklift accidents happen when a driver drops a payload.</p>

The LHM200SC pallet truck in the BT Lifter L-series is equipped with a scale to provide high-accuracy weighing during the material handling process. Lifted truck maintenance services require assessment of your brakes, shocks, wheels, as well as tires.</p>

Skid steers, excavators, dump trailers, tractors, lifts and shredders are just some of the types of heavy equipment we offer to help you with whatever the job requires.</p>
