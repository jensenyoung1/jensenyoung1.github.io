<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>
<p>France and Italy are on the upsurge of adopting the electric Forklift Trucks, which would be a key driver for the trucking industry in the region. These advanced electric forklifts are equipped with the newest generation of AC technology, assuring you industry-leading performance. Since order pickers drive an order picker lifts (industrial powered trucks), they have to complete order picker training and obtain an order pick license to work in the United States.</p>
