<p>JCB rough terrain forklifts are a reliable, comfortable, versatile and easy-to-use solution for any challenging rehandling environment. A electric hand pallet truck is one of the most commonly used lift trucks in industrial companies. Should you operate forklift trucks you will be aware that all drivers need to be properly trained and certified. We're here to answer your questions and to finally put to rest which is better, a lifted truck or a lowered truck. Yet, another place where pallet trucks can be useful that is often overlooked is in a retail work environment.</p>
