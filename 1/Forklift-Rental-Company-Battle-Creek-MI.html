Their decision to go with a Liftking product was in part due to the versatility of Liftking's robust rough-terrain forklift,‚Äù says Mark Aldrovandi, sales manager at Liftking. The most important things to know when you choose a forklift are its size, lift and load capacity, and configuration.</p>
<p>Reach forklifts exemplify these features as they can reach higher storage levels than standard models and have a better control response time. Standard 2-ton counterbalance forklifts can cost over $20,000 in good condition, and many cost much more when brought brand new.
