<h2>Difference Between Forklifts Vs Pallet Jacks in Levelland </h2>
<p>The sense of rotation of the control handle is intended to be in the same direction as the desired motion of the mast or load. This is an example of a ruggedly constructed forklift and is designed to be used primarily outdoors.

<p>In addition, while reach trucks can be used at heights up to 40ft, this position places physical strain upon the operator's neck and eyes and so it not a recommended height for frequent use.
