They can reach heights up to 390″ Orderpickers are typically powered by 24- or 36-volt industrial batteries. Shock absorbers manage the kinetic energy that travels through your Jeep's suspension and chassis as you drive to give you a bump-free ride and keep other components from wearing out too quickly.</p>
<p>If your warehouse is stocked full of pallets, a warehouse forklift is an efficient way to carefully load and remove balanced inventory from industrial shelving. Visit your local big-box superstore like Costco's, Sam's Club, Lowe's or Home Depot, and it's hard not to notice all those forklifts. However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>

<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
