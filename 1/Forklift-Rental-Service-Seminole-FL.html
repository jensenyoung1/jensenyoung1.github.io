If you work in a small warehouse or need lift trucks for short runs, you can never go wrong with using electric motor hand trucks.</p>
<h2>What Is A Pallet Truck Seminole </h2>
<p>These trucks, converted with a standard suspension lift, large tires, and quality safety technology, are built to handle off-road driving, road trips, or work at construction sites. Many truck shoppers in the Lexington, Frankfort, Winchester, and Nicholasville area know they can count on Georgetown Auto Sales to give them a great selection of trucks, lifted or not, and a fair deal with honest sales.</p>

It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>

No matter your brand, the team at Nations Trucks has a lifted truck that's calling your name. Lifted truck tires need to be specialized to fit the driver's unique plans for the vehicle.
