The air springs will provide load support for your truck and will automatically inflate or deflate with air pressure based on the load you are attempting to carry.</p>
<p>Wang says that Hangcha will continue to invest in rough-terrain R&D, particularly in developing equipment with more tonnage and configurations. Rough terrain poses additional threats and risks to the operators of forklifts. However, suspension lift kits let the truck owners lift their truck as high as they want. They have been renting out equipment for over 50 years.</p>

Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>
