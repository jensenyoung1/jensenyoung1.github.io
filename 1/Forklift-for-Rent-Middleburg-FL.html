The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load. Popular brands of standup forklifts include Yale, Crown, Baker, Hyster, and Raymond, which range in price from as little as $5,000 used to as much as $35,000 for a fully equipped new machine. Counterbalanced forklifts carry their loads in front of their support point.</p>
<p>If you do decide to go ahead and lift your truck, take extra care when operating it to ensure safety, and check everything underneath regularly for wear and tear to prevent and accelerated damage that may occur. However, the term rough terrain‚Äù does not imply that the forklift can be safely operated on every conceivable type of terrain. If you work in a small warehouse or need lift trucks for short runs, you can never go wrong with using electric motor hand trucks.</p>

Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components.
