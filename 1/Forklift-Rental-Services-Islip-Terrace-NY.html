Reach trucks are used most in warehouses for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.

Elevating forks allow for easy placement of picked items onto the pallet, whilst the walk-through version allows the handling of bulky loads, enhancing operator comfort and efficiency.
