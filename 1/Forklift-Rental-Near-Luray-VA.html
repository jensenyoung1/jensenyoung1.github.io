<p>Specifically engineered for the unique challenges of a narrow-aisle warehouse environment, the Crown RR 5700 features the industry's first traction control system, enhanced execution of load-handling functions, and the fastest lift and travel speeds among other available reach trucks. The aim of this course is to provide delegates with the knowledge and practical skills needed to safely operate an Industrial Masted Lift Truck. Whether a forklift will safely carry a load or will tip forward can be determined by comparing the moment (a tendency to produce motion) of both the load and the forklift. Our rental fleet stands ready to supply you with immediate equipment when a need arises.</p>
<p>3300-4500 mm Duplex or Triplex clear-view mast options available, to give you flexibility in customising your forklift for the job at hand. Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>

The lifting forks rise up to 31.5 inches, which saves the operator unnecessary bending and heavy lifting and increases efficiency in repetitive handling operations. Unlike standard forklifts, Agria are fitted with heavy duty pneumatic tyres, specifically designed for rough terrain operation.</p>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts can have a vertical tower, which lifts loads straight up, or a telescoping boom, which lifts loads up and out from the base of the machine. Maini's floor transportation range enables effortless transfer of heavy loads in your shop floors and warehouses. Motorized pallet jacks or manual pallet jacks are found in nearly every warehouse and are essential in many manufacturing and distribution work environments.</p>
<p>When driving rough terrain forklifts, safety should always come first. Employers who fail to have their workers properly trained and licensed to operate forklifts in the workplace expose themselves to expensive OSHA fines and severe penalties. Also, the use of technologically well-versed forklift trucks in this region is gaining maximum traction and supplementing the growth of the truck industry.</p>
