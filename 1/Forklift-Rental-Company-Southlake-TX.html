<h2>Automation Of An Industrial Fork Lift Truck in Southlake </h2>
<p>Designed to increase productivity when handling heavy loads, the innovative and unique BT Pro Lifter model LHM230P requires up to 67% less force than a standard hand pallet truck to begin moving. Pallet jacks - also called order pickers, typical pallet jacks can lift approximately 3,300 pounds. Dayton® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>
<p>The pallet jack drop lever is often a small lever in the middle of the rounded handle, on the vertical stem of the manual machine.
