<p>A forklift that raises your intralogistics to a new level. Renting provides economical and practical solutions to reflect the changing needs of your business and helps you better adjust to any aberrations in your daily routine. Note: In order to receive your C4 Forklift Operation Certification, you must take and pass a performance evaluation given by your employer at your job site. All-terrain and off-road tires in very large sizes can be crucial for conquering particularly difficult and hazardous trails.</p>
<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>
