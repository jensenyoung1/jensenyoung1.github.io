Larger Tires: You're able to attach larger tires to a lifted truck to get more traction off road or in snow.</p>
<p>Depending on your needs, purchasing equipment may not make sense, MH Equipment features one of the largest material handling and construction equipment rental fleets in the Midwest. This is very important to the safety of the forklift operator. LOAD CENTER: The horizontal longitudinal distance from the intersection of the horizontal load-carrying surfaces and vertical load-engaging faces of the forks (or equivalent load positioning structure) to the center of gravity of the load.</p>
<p>8 Finished forklifts are shipped to the customer or distributor by truck or by rail.

Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>Available in both manual and electric operated versions, pallet trucks come in different variants to suit desired applications. The load limit of the lift truck decreases as the load centre is raised. Your solution: a high-capacity electric forklift.
