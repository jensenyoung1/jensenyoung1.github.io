Fork Force has a range of used rough terrain forklifts for sale and hire at highly competitive prices. Performance Accessories designed the Premium Lift System as an affordable solution to lifting both the body as well as the suspension of your truck.</p>
<p>Forklifts, at maximum, can only travel 8 mph or 3 mph around people, but even at that speed, one of these 4-ton vehicle's steel tusks can puncture your machinery and shut down your operation. We will conduct a learner analysis to identify the duration of training required for those with limited or no experience, whereas experienced operators can attend a one day Experienced Worker Assessment (Test Only).</p>
<p>We offer Forklift and Crane Rental Services at cost-effective prices. The counterbalance” term refers to the weight distribution for cargo loads; any pallets or merchandise are counterbalanced against the weight of the machine.

When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials. The redesign includes modifying the forklift chain and the mast inner channel to create a wider window creating better visibility. The lift trucks are used to unload, lift, lower and stack pallet loads, or other bulk loads into storage and transportation racks and facilities.</p>
<p>Lift Capacity: 14000 lbs. Forklifts are designed to lessen the load for you.
