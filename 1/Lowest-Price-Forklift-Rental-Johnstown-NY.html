<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
<p>This includes, but is not limited to, straddle carriers, hustlers, toploaders, container reach stackers, and other vehicles that carry, push, pull, lift, or tier loads. Place empty truck on initially level test platform in a position that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the test platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>
