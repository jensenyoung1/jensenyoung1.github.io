A few strokes of the handle provide 110mm of lift, the PMHE-107 heavy duty pump is built to take thousands of pick-up and deposit cycles.</p>
<p>These are Sit-down forklifts designed for indoor use with solid, cushioned tires â€” powered by internal-combustion (IC) engines that run on diesel fuel or, more commonly, LP gas.
