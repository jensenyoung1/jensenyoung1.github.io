This is among a very good quality pallet truck with great durability and support. Call to discuss load types and warehouse limitations for your safety and accuracy. The rough-terrain or straight-mast forklift has become more of a niche machine, rather than an ‘everybody-needs-one' machine,” says Charlie Detrich, U.S. sales & dealer development manager for Liftking.</p>
<p>Here at Lifted Trucks, we have an extensive inventory of custom or lifted trucks and SUVs, SUVs, sedans, and stock trucks.
