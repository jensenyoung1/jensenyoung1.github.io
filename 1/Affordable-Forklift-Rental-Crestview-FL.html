Once re-rated the forklift should have a new factory authorized specification plate, to replace the original plate, installed showing the new rating for the lift. The ITA says year-end lift truck sales totaled 260,180, with electric and internal combustion truck sales growing at similar rates (showing annual increases of 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively).</p>

In other words if you are unloading pallets from racking and your top beam is at 144” you will need a lift truck that has a maximum fork height of a few inches higher to ensure you will be able to lift pallet above the rack and then remove the pallet from the racks.</p>
<p>The Forklift Network has 170 dealers across North America including Canadian Provinces, and has thousands of used electric forklifts for sale. The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it. The name comes from the counterweight in the rear of the vehicle.

Standard forklifts generally measure between 4 to 7 ft wide and 8 to 10 ft long. Knowing your required lift height is equally important and will affect your unit's load-carrying capacity.</p>
