<p>All types of dockboards should be designed and maintained so the end edges will have a substantial contact with the dock (or loading platform) and the carrier to prevent the dockboard from rocking of sliding.

We have specialized in new and used forklift sales in Surrey, Vancouver and surrounding areas for over 41 years.
