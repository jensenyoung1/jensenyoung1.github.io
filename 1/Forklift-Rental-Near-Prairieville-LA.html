<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely. Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support. Call Andy Putnam, Rental Manager (315) 413-4150 or use the Rentals Request form to send us a Quick Request.</p>
<p>You must know how to safely load, unload, and drive a rough terrain forklift to prevent accidents and injuries. This is best if you have a large warehouse or need different types of lifts for the jobs you'll be doing. If you test drive your lifted trucks hurriedly, you will fail to pay close attention to some signs you should be watching out for. The Forklift Order Picker Cages have durable wire mesh backs and side panels and are to be used in conjunction with a body harness (for working at heights).</p>

<p>We manufacture, export, import and supply a wide range of equipment for Floor Transportation comprising of Electric Pallet Trucks, Scissor Hand Pallet Trucks, Hydraulic Hand Pallet Trucks and Electric Platform Trucks.

We can help your business identify your unique needs and help narrow your search for the right forklift or equipment to fit those needs, all while keeping you within your budget. Moving mast reach forklifts have a higher ground clearance due to larger wheels, but are unable to handle double deep racking responsibilities without a fork extension attachment.</p>
<p>In digging around facts about a forklift rental company, some things you might consider are the company's service level agreements, the age and condition of their forklifts available for rent, as well as the questions they ask to rental enquiries. Standard forklifts generally measure between 4 to 7 ft wide and 8 to 10 ft long. Knowing your required lift height is equally important and will affect your unit's load-carrying capacity.</p>

<p>We also have a generous selection of forklifts and material handling units from other leading brands, including Motrec, Terex, and Columbia. Rent diesel or LP-gas forklift or rent a specialized material handling forklift, such as a truck-mounted forklift or piggyback truck. If your company needs a forklift, but your financial manager cringes at the expense of buying one, it's probably time to consider alternative options.</p>
